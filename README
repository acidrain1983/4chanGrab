ABOUT
==================

4chanGrab was developed by Random Translator to download images from 4chan, it has since been taking over by the community at large. I decided to go and modify 4chanGrab to support the newest versions of Firefox and 4chan's new API. This version is based off 1.3 that has been floating around.
