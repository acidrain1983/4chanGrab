ABOUT
==================

4chanGrab (formerly known as not4chan grab) was developed by Random Translator to download images from 4chan, it has since been taking over by the community at large. I decided to go and modify 4chanGrab to support the newest versions of Firefox and 4chan's new API. This version is based off 4chanGrab 1.8.2 by Josh VH.

CHANGE LOG
==================

Version 2.0.7:
	- 4chan changed their page paths, replacing the standard /res/ location to /thread/ breaking the filenames. It normally would have worked without the API but they also changed the page layout also.
	- Use the i.4cdn.org instead of images.4chan.org, and 4chan no longer uses /src/
	- You can see all the changes here 4chan made here: http://blog.4chan.org/post/82477681005/upcoming-namespace-changes
	- Changed the extention to support Firefox versions until Versions 50. The release cycle for FF releases 40 in the first 2 months of 2015, as no updates they have done in the past 20 versions have conflicted with this extention I highly doubt any of the future ones will. If there is one it would be fixed in a timely manner.
Version 2.0.6:
	- Fixed a bug where the subject for a reply would be identified as the thread title
	- When using the 4chan API, if the API returns a 404 (thread has been deleted) you will have the option to revert to using the old page scraping method
Version 2.0.5:
	- Added support for all board types from http://archive.foolz.us/_/articles/credits/ (installgentoo is enabled due to the regex but beware missing files)
	- Added support for original filenames on archive.foolz.us
	- Fixed a bug where not all the files on foolz.us was checking the MD5 in instances when the filesize was 1MB or bigger
Version 2.0.4:
	- Fixed a height bug in the image dialog box
	- Added a Check Files call to the title folder checkbox to auto check the files if the option is enabled
	- Changed it so that it'll not disable the dialog box when all the files are MD5 matched and you click save or check files
	- Misc bug fixes
	- Added support for archive.foolz.us archives (no original filename support at the moment)
	- Added Google Analytics call to track version usage, It'll track when you install/update the extention and when you bring up the dialog that has links to download
Version 2.0.3:
	- Implemented checking of existing files with the MD5 sum (Using Webworkers to do the work in the background) if they match, the file is disabled
	- Recheck files button was added to allow you to recheck the files such as when you change the folder name, change the title field, or rename the files
	- Added option to disable the automatic checking of existing files, you can check the files at anytime by clicking the "Recheck Files" button
	- Tweaked the regex to match more boards
Version 2.0.2:
	- Fixed download code that didn't get carried over from Version 2.0 that was associated with private browsing mode
	- Cleaned up the options dialog, making it a bit more readable
	- Replaced 4chanarchive.org with chanarchive.org
	- Added the ability to automatically create a folder in your save path based on the subject of the thread and use it for files, You can manually type in a custom folder name if you so wish
	- Added default option for checkbox that enables the folder based on the subject
Version 2.0.1:
	- Updated code to be based off of 4chanGrab 1.8.2 by Josh VH.
	- Removed/Disabled any "Auto update" buttons or preferences, they did nothing so no point in having the options.
	- Added a "Automatically close window on successful download" preference, by default it will automaticlly close the window on successful download
Version 2.0:
	- Initital commit to Github
	- Based off of 1.3 that was floating around
	- Updated extention to use 4chan's new json API instead of scraping their html, will no longer break on html changes
	- Updated downloading code to fix error about privacy, and enable downloading in private browsing mode
	- This version should support all the lattest versions of Firefox, and support for future versions up until version 30
Version 1.x:
	- Any changes made prior to Version 2.0 was by Random Translator or the community.

TO DO
=========

I've been thinking of stuff that would be nice to have:
	- Automaticlly create (by option) folders based on the board and thread title (IE. <base folder>/a/Neko Thread/) [Implemented without board folder in v2.0.2]


Unsupported Archive Sites
=========

I've been asked to add support for some archives such as archive.foolz.us which I have added but there are some archives such as archive.installgentoo.net which is pretty pointless to add because it links the original images back to the source website, unless they also store the original file like foolz does I won't be adding it and I will only add archive sites that stores the original source image. If you would like me to add support for a specific site see the requests section above.
