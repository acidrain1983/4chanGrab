ABOUT
==================

4chanGrab was developed by Random Translator to download images from 4chan, it has since been taking over by the community at large. I decided to go and modify 4chanGrab to support the newest versions of Firefox and 4chan's new API. This version is based off 4chanGrab 1.8.2 by Josh VH.

CONTRIBUTE
==================

As I know there are a lot of versions of 4chanGrab floating around the net feel free to fork this and submit a pull request, I will try to review any pull request within 48 hours or at least reply.

DOWNLOAD
========================

Latest version is available on github at:
    - https://raw.github.com/acidrain1983/4chanGrab/master/4chanGrab.xpi

CHANGE LOG
==================

Version 2.0.1:
	- Updated code to be based off of 4chanGrab 1.8.2 by Josh VH.
	- Removed/Disabled any "Auto update" buttons or preferences, they did nothing so no point in having the options.
	- Added a "Automatically close window on successful download" preference, by default it will automaticlly close the window on successful download
Version 2.0:
	- Initital commit to Github
	- Based off of 1.3 that was floating around
	- Updated extention to use 4chan's new json API instead of scraping their html, will no longer break on html changes
	- Updated downloading code to fix error about privacy, and enable downloading in private browsing mode
	- This version should support all the lattest versions of Firefox, and support for future versions up until version 30
Version 1.x:
	- Any changes made prior to Version 2.0 was by Random Translator or the community.

TO DO
=========

I've been thinking of stuff that would be nice to have:
	- Automaticlly create (by option) folders based on the board and thread title (IE. <base folder>/a/Neko Thread/)
	- [4chan using API only] If the file exists, check the filesize and md5 (if filesize matches) prior to showing the window and automaticlly uncheck the files if they match
